        Movie Recommendation System 

Overview :

This project is a Smart Movie Recommendation System that provides personalized movie suggestions based on user preferences and contextual factors. The system leverages machine learning techniques to analyze datasets and recommend movies that align with specific user interests.

Approach & Methodology :

Data Collection: The dataset consists of movies with details like title, director, genre, cast, rating, revenue, and more.

Data Processing: Cleaning and transforming raw movie data for better insights.

Feature Engineering: Extracting meaningful features such as genre similarity, actor-director collaboration, and user preferences.

Recommendation Algorithm:

Content-Based Filtering: Recommends movies based on genres, actors, and directors.

Collaborative Filtering: Suggests movies based on user behavior and preferences.

Hybrid Approach: Combines both techniques for better accuracy.

Search & Filtering System: Implements predefined searches such as:

Science Fiction Action Movies with Bruce Willis

Quentin Tarantino movies starring Uma Thurman

Pixar's most successful movies (2010-2015)

Action/Thriller movies in English with a rating above 7.5

Top-rated Christopher Nolan movies

Animated Oscar-winning movies

Data Preprocessing & Selection :

Data Cleaning: Removed duplicates, handled missing values, and normalized numerical fields.

Feature Selection: Selected relevant features such as genre, director, cast, rating, and box office revenue.

Data Splitting: Divided the dataset into training and test sets for evaluation.

Model Architecture & Tuning Process :

Baseline Models: Implemented simple recommendation algorithms like weighted average rating.

Machine Learning Models: Used models like K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and Matrix Factorization (SVD).

Hyperparameter Tuning: Applied GridSearchCV for optimizing parameters in models.

Context-Aware Improvements: Integrated sentiment analysis and contextual factors (e.g., weather, time of day) to refine recommendations.

Performance Results & Next Steps :

Performance Evaluation :

Metrics Used: RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error) is 1.267, Precision is 90, Recall is 100 and also confusion matrix is done.

Results: The hybrid model showed the best results, balancing content-based and collaborative filtering.

Next Steps :

Improve recommendation diversity to avoid repetitive suggestions.

Integrate real-time user feedback to refine recommendations dynamically.

Expand dataset with streaming platform data (e.g., Netflix, Hulu, Disney+).

Deploy as a web application with a user-friendly interface.
